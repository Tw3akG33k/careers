## Systems Engineer Levels

### Legend

The matrix below explains the requirements for engineering levels. Each level
has to match at least one of the requirements for the level and the level
before it.

Not all skills go to level 6. This is determined by the focus of Teleport.

For example, security skills are more relevant, as we are a security oriented
company, and we are interested in R&D level 6 engineers, however OS/tooling is
not the primary focus, so basic levels are satisfactory.

As the level advances past 4, the focus shifts from technical skills to
bringing products to market, as it's more relevant to Teleport as a for-profit
startup.

Skills are a mix of technical and communication abilities. Some references to
security are based on the coding challenge.
